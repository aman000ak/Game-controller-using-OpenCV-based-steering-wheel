# Computer Vision Steering and Control System

## Overview

This project consists of Python scripts for implementing a computer vision-based steering and control system. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and keyboard emulation to control a virtual object based on the detected colors in the video stream.

The project contains the following functionalities across multiple files:
- **File 1**: Steering control using color detection for left, right, and nitro actions.
- **File 2**: Keyboard emulation for sending key inputs.
- **File 3**: Color detection and steering control with enhanced stability and efficiency.

## Features

- **Real-time Color Detection**: Detects specific colors in a live video stream using OpenCV.
- **Steering Control**: Controls virtual steering based on the detected colors.
- **Keyboard Emulation**: Emulates keyboard inputs for controlling virtual actions.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure Python is installed along with required libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and imutils.
   
2. **File Execution**:
   - Execute File 1 to implement basic steering control using color detection.
   - Execute File 2 to utilize keyboard emulation for sending key inputs.
   - Execute File 3 for enhanced color detection and steering control.

3. **Configure Parameters**: Adjust color thresholds and trackbar values for optimal detection performance.
   
4. **Run the Script**: Start the script and observe the video stream for color detection and steering control.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
